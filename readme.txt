Defining strategies
Two strategies:
Momentum buying: buy when stocks are trending to go up
Rule: player buys, only after a initial 10 % increase (so only if the stocks have clearly been going up, and not going down more than 5% inbetween) exits after 10% up or 10% down

 
Value investing: buy when stocks are lower than they are worth 
Rule: player buys only if stock is below 30 day trendline (50 day trendline sets worth of stock) sells after 20% up or 10% down 





B: value
B: momentum
A: Value

Hypothesis, you would expect when the majority of players are using value strategy, as soon as the is below the actual worth, it would rise very fast. But for momentum as well, if majority players are investing with momentum strategy, and stock starts to rise it will start rising faster

Basically this IA is investigating the theory that if too many players adopt the same strategy it will diminish the effectiveness.

We say that x is the number of players using momentum strategy
F(x) stands for payoff (an arbitrary number quantifying profits)

For momentum trading:
fm(x)=mx+c
Where c stands for the maximum amount of pay off from the strategy, assuming the payoff decreases when more players use momentum strategy. (expect m to be negative).

For value trading:
fv(x)=mx+c
Where more players using momentum strategy means more payoff for value stratagie

Goal is to find the perfect ratio of momentum traders to value traders so that both profit the most.
